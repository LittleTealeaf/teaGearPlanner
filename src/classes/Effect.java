    /*
    Goals with 2.0.1
     - Single Effect class, which changes itself depending on what the user needs

     Functionality
        Editing node has the text field for attributes, bonus types, and value

        When the user separates multiple attributes by commas (','), the program changes the attribute field on all displays to a combo-box with all attributes
        When the user inputs a range of numbers into the value field (such as "1-4"), the program replaces the value with a spinner that ranges between those values.

     Notes:
        The attribute separation is combined with the type, so the drop-down menu will have "Insightful Constitution", "Insightful Wisdom", etc.
